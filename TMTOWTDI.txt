There's More Than One Way To Do It... usually.

Listing the contents of a wad file:
lswad, spitwad, deutex -wadir, warm -dir, dmpsmu (interactive)

Extracting raw lumps from a wad file:
wadext, dmpsmu

Extracting sfx from a wad file (not in id's internal format):
deutex -sounds (RIFF Wave with -wav, or Sun .au files w/header),
dm2au (raw samples, RIFF Wave format, headerless .au), xew

Extracting graphics from a wad file in PPM format:
deutex (also does .bmp and .gif), wadext + raw2ppm (if you can get it
to work), wadflat, wadsprit, wadtex, wadpat, xew

Copying data from one (or more) wad file(s) to another:
deutex, wadext + wadgc or mkwad, warm -m, wadcat

Building nodes, reject, etc:
idbsp, bsp, warm, wreject

Creating a wad file from scratch:
deutex -make, mkwad, wadgc

BTW, dmpsmu is actually a modified DEU. You can do a lot with it besides
print PostScript level maps.
