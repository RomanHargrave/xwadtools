These instructions are for Linux, and probably work OK on other UNIX-like
systems. If not, see INSTALL.old.

Required dependencies:
GNU make
GCC and G++
standard stuff like bash and sed (likely part of your OS already)

Optional dependencies (and what you need them for):
XForms library - for xew
NetPBM - for wadconvgfx, also generally useful for working with
         extracted Doom graphics (deutex and wadextract both
         create ppm files).
Perl - for wadconvgame, wadconvgfx, mergewad
Tcl/Tk - for tkwadcad

Most (probably all) of this stuff can be installed using your
distribution's package manager (apt-get, yum, slackpkg/sbopkg, whatever
you've got), and that's the preferred way to install them.

XForms is required at compile time, if you want to use it. The other
optional deps can be installed later without rebuilding xwadtools.

To compile, you can just say "make". To install to /usr/local/,
"make install" (as the root user; use su or sudo).

There are a few useful variables you can pass to the Makefile:

XFORMS=yes
  Build xew. The default is not to build it. xwadtools is still very
  useful without it: xew is basically a GUI that does the same things
  as some of the command line tools.

PREFIX=/usr
  Install everything in /usr rather than /usr/local.  This path gets
  compiled into some of the tools, so they can find their data files.

BINDIR, SHAREDIR, MANDIR, DOCDIR
  Default to PREFIX/bin, PREFIX/share/xwadtools, PREFIX/share/man,
  PREFIX/share/doc/xwadtools. Some folks like to set BINDIR=PREFIX/games,
  to avoid cluttering /usr/bin with "useless" games.

DESTDIR
  Default: empty. Used with "make install" to install everything to some
  place other than the actual PREFIX (e.g. for making a distro package)

GZIP_MAN=no
  By default, man pages are gzipped during "make install". Set this option
  to install the man pages uncompressed.

STRIP_BINS=no
  By default, binaries are installed stripped of debugging symbols. Set
  this option to install the binaries unstripped.

After installation, "man xwadtools" will give you an overview
of what the various tools are. Also see the documentation in
/usr/local/share/doc/xwadtools (or whatever you set DOCDIR to).

Note to slackware users: "su -c make slackware" will build an i486
package. If you're using slackware64, try "su -c make slackware
ARCH=x86_64". You may or may not want to add XFORMS=yes to your make
command, too.

The rest of this document is from Udo's original INSTALL (edited somewhat;
see INSTALL.old for the whole thing).

Testing... Playing...
---------------------
In the directory examples there are Makefiles which uses the tools
to build PWAD files and such. So to try out your installed tools, you
could just type make in the directories and examine the results and
try to play the PWAD files with some game engine. The command 'make clean'
gets rid of all produced temporary files.

If you're using UNIX and have XDoom installed, try the testbench in
directory toolstest. All node builders and map compilers/de-compilers
will be tested to some degree by this. [Note: the test depends on XDoom,
which most users won't have installed, and which would require quite
a bit of work to get to compile on modern systems - bkw]

Have a look at the slige directory too, there are shell scripts which
create some random Doom PWAD's with slige and process them with all included
node builders. This is pretty good to test out the tools some more.

Notes:
------
WAD tool programmers who would like to work on this stuff should check
the functions in the lib directory and header files in the include
directory. If possible use them and if you find functions which are
needed by various tools, then add them to the library. Probably
the tools still include redundant functions which should be moved
into the library.
