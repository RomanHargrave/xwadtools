See "ChangeLog.old" for Udo's changes.

20120227 bkw:

- testsuite, made a pretty good start on.

- Add - option to trigcalc (normal I/O rather than termios). Allow
  it to compile for mingw (acts like - always present).

- various minor man page fixes

20120223 bkw:

- Fixed FreeBSD 9.0 compile.

- Added crosswin target. Borrowed a fnmatch() implementation from
  OpenBSD, since mingw-w64 seems to lack one.

20120222 bkw:

- Rename Andre's strlcat() to str_lower_cat(). Some OSes (FreeBSD and
  the MinGW cross compiler I have) define a strlcat() that does
  something different.

  - Only include internal strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() if
  !defined(HAVE_STRCASECMP). I don't have an exhaustive knowledge of
  which platforms do and don't provide this function, so the Makefile
  will define HAVE_STRCASECMP by default, with a note to the user.

- lswad's -F now correctly accepts FF_START as start-of-flats marker. Also
  added a warning if -F is used, and there are flats, but no F_END.

- Upgraded deutex to Amajorel Andre's 4.4.902, from here:
  http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/deutex/fungus/deutex-4.4.902.tar.gz
  I've made only one minor change to his code: the default log file
  is now /dev/null (can still set it with -log option, if you really
  want).

- Added John Carmack's old wadspit tool, from dmutils.zip. Find the
  original version here:
  http://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames/historic/dmutils.zip

20120221 bkw:

- added a generic man page "doom.6". Too many source ports don't
  supply a man page. Some of them don't supply any documentation
  on command line options at all (or it'll only be documented on
  their web site).

- man pages now installed gzipped by default. "make install GZIP_MAN=no"
  disables.

- binaries are no longer linked with -s (stripped). However, they're
  installed that way by default. "make install STRIP_BINS=no" to
  install unstripped binaries.

20120220 bkw:

- wadcat, mkqmap, mkpopal, mkgipal, mkxppal, mktran were all
  segfaulting if their options that require an argument were given at
  the end of the command line (e.g. "mkqmap -c"), added NULL checks

20120219 bkw:

- New utilities wadwhich, wadconvgame, wadconvgfx

- "make install" now installs the docs (to DOCDIR)

- "make install" now installs mergewad and tkwadcad

20120215 bkw:

- All of Andre Amajorel's patches have been integrated.

- All the tools now compile and run correctly on x86_64 Linux (so far
  as I've been able to determine). This took some effort!

- Makefile.lin has been renamed to Makefile. The other Makefile.* remain,
  but they haven't been updated for this release. I will accept patches
  from anyone who wants to use this on non-Linux systems, but I don't
  have the resources to do any testing on anything but Linux.

- Makefile now supports PREFIX and DESTDIR, should make life easier for
  packagers.

- XForms is now optional, can build with "make USE_XFORMS=no". It's only
  used for xew, so xew won't be built if XForms is disabled.

- The acc utility is now installed as acc-raven, to avoid conflicts with
  the acc utilities provided by VaVoom and ZDoom.

- libfindwad: new library that searches for WAD files in a uniform manner.
  Tools are slowly being updated to use it. See ENVIRONMENT section of
  xwadtools manpage for usage details; see include/findwad.h for API
  and lib/findwad.c for implementation.
  Currently these tools support libfindwad:
  dm2au  wadps  wadwhat  lswad  wadsprit  wadpat  wadtex  wadext
  wadtxls  wadflat

- dm2au:
  New options -r (raw audio output) and -w (wav output).
  Output file can be specified, and can be - for standard output.
  Man page contains a few examples for using dm2au with sox.

- New utility midi3mus. Converts MIDI files to MUS lumps. Written by natt
  on the DoomWorld forums, thread:
  http://www.doomworld.com/vb/doom-editing/55814-midi2mus-64-bit-compatible/

- slige now falls back to $LIBDIR/slige/slige.cfg if no -config or
  $SLIGECONFIG is given and if slige.cfg doesn't exist in the current
  directory.

- wadps: Default game changed to doom2. Behaviour for
  doom II wads now matches doom I, when no level is selected (all maps
  are included in the output; previously the output was just empty).

- lswad: Added --help/-? option. Needed because its default action is now
  to list the contents of the default IWAD.

- wadtxls: Output now sent to stdout if no -o is given.
  Episode and Mission (-e and -m) arguments are no longer required; they
  default to E1M1 for doom 1 and MAP01 for doom 2.

- raw2sfx: outfile argument can be - for stdout. Warn if there's a RIFF or id
  sfx header, or if the input's really short.

- various compiler warnings have been squelched. Quite a few are left.
